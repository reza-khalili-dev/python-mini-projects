# Python Mini Projects Hub

A collection of small, fun and practical Python projects.  
Each project lives in its own folder inside `projects/` and follows a consistent template so contributors and users can quickly run, build, and extend projects.

---

## Goals
- Provide short, complete projects that are easy to read and run.
- Each project should include: `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, runnable source, and optional `dist/` for compiled executables.
- Be open-source and welcoming to contributors.

---

## How to use
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/python-mini-projects.git
cd python-mini-projects
